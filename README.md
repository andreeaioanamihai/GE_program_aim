     Introduction:
     
GE Aviation, a subsidiary of General Electric, is among the top aircraft engine suppliers, and offers engines for the majority of commercial aircraft. GE Aviation rises to the challenge to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely.      


     Task 1: Data Engineering
     
• Create a single data set that combines all the data given into a single table. The data  has sheets related to Flight data (so data relating to the health of the mechanical engine of a plane), Location Data for airports, Manufacturing Data (which relate to various airplane parts), and a manufacturing bill of material (which tells you what engines have been used).


     Task 2: Data Visualization
     
• The task is to create a run chart using Tableau that will visualize the measurement of a given feature of each operation for a given part number. We need to identify whether the measurement is in or out of a given specification of that given feature (required design attribute) to showcase to your supply chain management team on how the manufacturing process is performing.
